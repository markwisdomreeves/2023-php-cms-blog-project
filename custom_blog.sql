Those who survived the severity of the virus must be grateful to God Almighty that 2021 affords them another opportunity to recover what they had lost to Covid-19. Would you look forward to 2021 as a year of refreshing opportunities? It\'s never too late now to change your course of action.\r\n\r\nDon\'t settle for less despite how difficult things had been. Nothing in life is worth deserving without fighting for. Engage your dream, ambition, and vision and become a legend in your dispensation. You are transitioning to a moment to discover and recover, which ties to the principle of seeking and finding. Discover your true identity, and stop trying to become someone or something you are not. Otherwise, you may never see the good in yourself. Unless you discover, you won’t recover!\r\n\r\nMay I illustrate \'discover to recover\' by describing the functionalities of a computer Recycle Bin. We can draw from its dual operations – delete & recover – to teach a practical life lesson. As a computer end-user, I would mistakenly and initially delete a file and thought I had lost it forever. As my computer knowledge increased, I learned how to recover deleted files to the original directory. Sometimes, I may choose to delete the files finally from my computer memory. This example teaches that there’s hope for recovery.\r\n\r\nSee yourself as the best in your generation. Your failure to discover yourself could make it impossible if not difficult to recover from situations imposing stagnation, suppression, joblessness, poverty, poor health condition, non-achievements, etc. Based on your knowledge of the previous year’s challenges, primarily concentrate on the most important things you wish to do. Be strategic in advancing your plans for 2021.\r\n\r\nLife is not a competition but a contribution. Never be intimated by the progress and achievements of your peers or superiors. Be inspired and work hard to make your contributions. Never subject yourself to envying others. Arise to your potential! You know yourself better than anybody else. Don’t allow situation condition you to a place. Step forward and aim at your dreams and visions. Discover who you want to become in life and how you would like to contribute to society. You have the power to add value to yourself by improving in areas of limitations and becoming creative and innovative.\r\n\r\nA few years ago, Cemenco, a cement company in my country hired me as a nightshift contractor. I worked in a division/department called “Recycle.\" Today I guess it still exists! My team and I were obligated to repackage burst cement bags. When there was a scarcity of cement in the Liberian market, the Management would hire women to sweep the entire compound, pile, and collect the cement dust from the ground for repackaging.\r\n\r\nWe would pour the cement dust into a certain kind of machine and refill new cement bags. That was a recovery in action! Management could not afford to lose their valuable materials. They discovered higher production increase sales, generate revenues, and reduce scarcity in the market. Similarly, you should add value to yourself and be marketable in your dispensation. It\'s time to discover and recover!\r\n\r\nDespite your limitations, count on your strength to explore your potentials. Far beyond what men can imagine, God sees the best in you. Life is worth living when you can discover who you are and where you are going. Discover to recover ties to the principle of seeking and finding. 2021 is the beginning of recovery for those who are ready to take a journey of discovery.', 'blog-post-1.jpg', '', 60, 36, '2022-11-20 10:45:19'),
(86, 'What Moves God: Need or Faith?', 'One of my favorite American writers, Philip Yancey raised a contemporary theological issue admitting to complex suffering in a sinful and dying world and how God\'s silence to seemingly discouraged and disappointed Christians is a commonly asked question.\r\n\r\nHe posed the question, \"Where Is God When It Hurts?\" (2010) to examine why God seems to be silent. Yancey interrogated the level of God\'s intervention in people\'s situations. A similar question could be posed today because of COVID-19. Sorrows, excruciating pains, and fears were ever-increasing in the world due to the spread and effects of COVID-19.\r\n\r\nMany reputable, lovely, and potential people died because of this deadly pandemic. Old and young, black and white races are being affected. The death rate was escalating daily, thus leaving economies to crumble, families to starve, schools and universities to shut down, increasing the unemployment rate, and as well as, creating constant restrictions in religious worship centers amongst others.\r\n\r\nAn attempt to rephrase Philip Yancey\'s question is a needed challenge to inquire about what moves God to answer prayer – need or faith? An African writer presents an argument that I think compliment Yancey\'s question. Thompson J. Washington in, The Faith Factor, argues that \"God will not meet you at the point of your needs but the point of your faith.\"\r\n\r\nFew African Christians tend to believe the first statement. They consider Philippians 4:19, \"But my God shall supply all your need according to his riches in glory by Christ Jesus.\" In this verse, Paul did not indicate the condition by which believers could access the riches of God, except for assuring that God possesses heavenly blessings and has enriched his people (Ephesians 1:3).\r\n\r\nOn the contrary, those who believe that God moves based on faith tend to agree with Hebrews 11:6, \"But without faith, it is impossible to please him: for he that cometh to God must believe that he is and that he is a rewarded of them that diligently seek him.\" Washington believes that faith is a means by which God responds to us and it can be justified by citing God\'s miraculous moves in human history.\r\n\r\nA classic example is the story of Abram, whose name was changed to Abraham (Genesis 15:6). In Genesis 15, Abraham needed a son to continue his lineage and subsequently fulfill the promise of becoming the father of many nations. God recognized his need but could only act based on the level of Abraham\'s faith.\r\n\r\nWhen Abraham\'s faith in God was accounted as righteousness (v.6), all of his needs were addressed. Amid this COVID-19 global pandemic, Christians should continue to pray fervently to God through faith so he would meet their needs. Paul reminds the Christians, \"For we walk by faith, not by sight\" (2 Corinthians 5:7).\r\n\r\nRegardless of the situation confronting the lives of Christians, faith permits God to act. Even if Christians should cry out to God, it should be done in faith, not as if they are complaining about their situation. God knows all of our needs yet he responds through our faith to address our needs.\r\n\r\nFor instance, God heard the cry of the Israelites and acted immediately because they expressed faith (Exodus 3:7). Throughout the ministry of Jesus, faith was a requirement for salvation, healing, deliverance, and miracles. All of those who came to Jesus and testified had some level of faith.\r\n\r\nFaith is the opposite of fear. Fear creates doubts and unbelief. Regardless of the effects of Coronavirus, Christians should trust in the power of God for healing, and acknowledge Jesus as the master healer. In March 2020, Liberia\'s first Coronavirus case was recorded: Nathaniel Blama was the first affected COVID-19 patient.\r\n\r\nFollowing the second week in April, another government official was diagnosed positive of Coronavirus. These two government officials are Christians, and they trusted and hoped in God for recovery. People interceded for them and they survived the severity of Coronavirus (Acts 12:5).\r\n\r\nReflecting on these testimonies, I recognize the faith of those prayerful and faithful intercessors. Therefore, Christians who are disappointed with God must understand that faith is a binding human response to get God\'s attention and that it leads to hope. Even if everything seems to be lost, all is not lost, because faith in God can change a story incredibly!', 'blog-post-2.jpg', '', 71, 36, '2022-11-20 10:48:58'),
(87, 'Fathers, Take Up Responsibility!', 'Since 2007 the world began to experience a serious economic crisis, the family has been greatly affected, as fathers cannot afford provisions for the home and mothers are gradually assuming the responsibility of the fathers.\r\n\r\nA few years ago, I listened to an interview conducted with children at various gambling centers in my country, Liberia. Of all the responses gathered as to why they chose to gamble, a little child said, “We are in the street gambling because our fathers don’t have accounts for us.”\r\n\r\nMany children are vulnerably roaming the streets because fathers have failed to take responsibility for the welfare of the family. Some fathers have willingly become liabilities to the family because their wives are doing part-time or full-time jobs.\r\n\r\nAlthough the world is evolving, and mothers are securing job opportunities to help upkeep the financial status of the home, God never intended the mothers to be the sole winners of the home or family.\r\n\r\nGenesis account reveals that God placed Adam in authority to look after the garden, as a father ought to care for his family. He was the breadwinner for his wife. God could not expect Adam to depend on his wife for provision. Rather, God Himself was Adam\'s utmost provider!\r\n\r\nNowadays, however, things are steadily changing about parental role and responsibility in the home. Because of modernization and what is termed as “gender equity,” fathers are losing control of their responsibility in the home. I do support the concept of gender equity but disagree that mothers completely take the role of the fathers in the home.\r\n\r\nDesignated as the helpmeet by God, mothers are to get involved in bringing up the children and make significant contributions to upkeep the home. But fathers should realize they are the heads and therefore must assume their responsibility for the welfare of the family.\r\n\r\nWhen a father assumes the financial responsibility of his family, all other responsibilities like raising or disciplining children among others will fall into place. Children are sensitive to whether their fathers are capable of addressing their basic needs.\r\n\r\nFailure on the fathers’ part, some children would disrespect or disobey their fathers. In the case of the child mentioned earlier, he justified his bad habit because of his father’s irresponsibility. He probably felt that his father was incapable of addressing his needs.\r\n\r\nTo this end, I suppose that one of the major factors contributing to poverty in Africa is because fathers have refused to take up responsibility.\r\n\r\nAccording to the book, “Ye Fathers” David G. Burkholder observed that the definition of a father has been limited to someone who only brings forth children into the world; beyond this meaning, he further encouraged fathers to care for the welfare of the family. To take up financial responsibility in the home, I recommend fathers to do the following:\r\n\r\n1. Get a job and earn a salary that can sustain the family\r\nBefore God presented Eve to Adam as his wife, Adam had a job which assumed a responsibility “to dress and to keep the garden” (Genesis 2:15).Adam could not have easily survived in the garden if he had not cultivated it well to produce good harvests.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, it is wise to have something doing before engaging in marriage. If a man is already married and doesn’t have a job, it is wiser and safer for him as a father to go out and find a job that would sustain him and the family.\r\n\r\nNo matter how much love wives and children may have for the fathers, if these fathers are not meeting up with their domestic roles, it is likely that they would lose their respect and ruin their integrity both in the home and society at large.\r\n\r\n2. Handle the finances wisely to sustain the family\r\nFathers are to wisely use the resources for the family that comes to the home. Whatever comes to the fathers belongs to the home! I am obliged to say this because I have observed that not all irresponsible fathers are jobless.\r\n\r\nSome fathers have lucrative jobs but cruelly refused to support their family. Their children have become gamblers and beggars in the streets and their wives have to carry the burdens of the family.\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly, real fathers are blessings rather than burdens. They are not liabilities but great access. Considering this situation, fathers must take up responsibility in the home; and together the family would celebrate them as real fathers in our world.', 'blog-post-3.jpg', '', 73, 36, '2022-11-20 10:50:54'),
(88, 'The Need for Adequate Public Latrines in Liberia.', 'Owing to the philosophy, “population brings growth,” I have observed that development via population growth is not without a challenge. In Liberia, limited public toilet facilities pose a serious challenge to the health of the population and the development of the country.\r\n\r\nI suppose that low budgetary support and overpopulation are the causes of this problem. Since 2015 Liberia\'s population started rapidly growing and is now estimated at 5.06million (World Population Review, 2020). JMP 2017 report reveals, \"Less than 20% of Liberians do not have access to privately-owned latrines. About 42% of the population practice open defecation.\"\r\n\r\nThe government of Liberia and its development partners had been committed to ensuring environmental health and sustainability by implementing a series of measures towards achieving the MDGs (#7) and SDGs (#6). However, there are still, unresolved public health issues confronting the health sector, with which lack of adequate public toilets is paramount.\r\n\r\nAccording to All Africa Liberia (December 2018), some influential government officials promised Liberians the construction of thousands of public toilet facilities in Monrovia but the promise has not been fulfilled. According to the Water and Sanitation Program (2012), Liberia had lost 17. 5 million US Dollars annually due to poor sanitation as citizens are being affected by waterborne diseases and infections.\r\n\r\nThis expenditure claimed a high budgetary allocation and depleted Government saving. Contrary to the saying, \"prevention is better than cure,\" it is obvious that the Liberian Government spends more on curative health than preventive care. Liberia has a fewer on-street toilets to accommodate travelers and passers-by.\r\n\r\nAlmost all of the on-street latrines are privately-owned. Attendants charge high service fees. These privately-owned public latrines are built with makeshift structures, muds, and concrete blocks but have limited rooms to accommodate 3-5 people at once. Notwithstanding, the Government of Liberia has built only a few off-street public toilets in some urban and rural communities.\r\n\r\nMany people do not have private latrines in their households. They use buckets as toilets and empty them at night. This problem threatens and compromises the health of the public, particularly residents of slum communities, of which women and girls are mostly affected with chronic infections.\r\n\r\nThe provision of public latrines is a significant aspect of ensuring environmental sustainability and achieving Sustainable Development Goals #3 (Good Health and Well-being) and #6 (Clean Water and Sanitation). Increasing the adequacy of public toilets implement a sustainable sanitation program across Liberia for the creation of a healthy environment.\r\n\r\nTo mitigate the threat to a healthy environment posed by inadequate public toilet facilities across Liberia, particularly in urban communities, key ministries and agencies must implement these strategies:\r\n\r\n1. Increase the number of public toilets in slum communities and other former settlements for the prevention of waterborne diseases and infections and eradication of open defecation.\r\n\r\n2. Prioritize the need for budgetary supports to step-up its intervention by increasing access to public toilet facilities across the country.\r\n\r\n3. Collaborate with private managers or NGOs to have interest and invest in the construction of on-street toilet facilities.\r\n\r\n4. Create a maintenance team to manage the operation and usage of the public toilet facilities to ensure environmental sustainability and prevent ushers from waterborne diseases and infections.\r\n\r\n5. Plant a signpost at intersections or on the roadsides to help travelers find the public toilets. Place the signpost blocks or meters away from the toilets\' destination to enable people from other regions or localities to access the public toilet.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to encourage private investors to take advantage of constructing on-street public toilets to ease the burden many Liberians are now facing. I think if the Government of Liberia has limited resources to prioritize this project, it would be welcoming for interested business individuals to study the case and remedy the situation.\r\n\r\nI assure whoever is interested will generate money from this project. Many Liberians cannot even access the limited existing toilet facilities constructed in communities. They would prefer using the on-street public toilet facilities, as long as they are clean and spacious.', 'blog-post-4.jpg', '', 77, 36, '2022-11-20 10:51:54'),
(89, 'Don’t Despise Your Small Beginnings!', 'The stories of great and successful people are often and widely read but with a little understanding of how they transitioned from not enough to more than enough.

Make sure to wisely use every opportunity available to you. Managing your small beginning now predicts how well you will handle bigger opportunities.

Even if nobody commends you, keep pushing and know that your labor is not in vain. At the appropriate time, God will use that little thing to announce you and people will be compelled to commend you on your success. Remember whatever you are doing now that seems little is the beginning of greatness. Don\'t despise your small beginning!\r\n\r\nBefore a tree grows bigger to bear flowers and fruits and be admired and fed upon, it must be first planted into the ground as a seed and after a while germinate to cause attraction and make provision.

Whether you are starting a new job that cannot fully sustain you or selling a type of product you are ashamed of, don\'t quit. You are almost to your breakthrough. Hold on to your current position until bigger opportunity is available to you.\r\n\r\nSome years ago, many Liberian women and girls were ashamed to sell on the streets. They depended on men for everything. Today, things have changed. I see potential and beautiful girls are selling cold water, sugar cane, cookies, and plastic bags on the streets of Monrovia.\r\n\r\nAlways be at your best at your small beginning. Few years ago, I didn’t despise my small beginnings. I sold on the streets, between cars, in video clubs, and other places. I was not ashamed of selling the least items because I had to assist my parents with provision in the home. At that time, women laughed at me, and called me all sort of names because I was carrying waiter on my head and holding bucket in my hand. I didn\'t care about their mockery. I was focused and pleased to help alleviate poverty from my family.\r\n\r\nHowbeit, I understood that the Liberian slogan “small, small” reinforces our courage and commitment to push forward in life regardless of our ups and downs.

(92, 'What Are The Benefits Of Water Purifier?', 'With the depleting quality of drinking water, more and more people are worrying for their health. With the reports stating the presence of dangerous chemicals and metals in water, they are becoming the major causes of health issues. The small doses of heavy metals and other chemicals can be safe to drink, but long run exposure to these lead to permanent health problem that can cost people lakhs of money and significantly impact their lives. The Water purifiers have become a dire need of every household for germ-free and clean drinking water without which you cannot live a healthy life.\r\n\r\nThe filtration, distillation and sedimentation processes are used in water purifiers to remove the harmful and unwanted chemicals, contaminants, dirt, harmful deposits and toxic gases from impure and dirty water. The option of bottled water is also not safe as the quality of the water is not known. There are several benefits of installing a fine quality water purifier at home. Some of the major benefits include:\r\n\r\n1. Pure, safe and Healthy Drinking Water\r\n\r\nThe first and the foremost reason of the water purifier is that they produce healthy water that is beneficial for us. Water that has gone through a water purifier will have less bacteria, fewer heavy metals, and possibly even less chemical pollution than water that comes straight from the tap People who regularly use a purifier find that one of the best benefits of a water purifier is the more alert, healthy feeling that they get from drinking pure water.\r\n\r\n2. Healthy taste of water\r\n\r\nOther sources of drinking water may taste metallic, or slightly bitter. This is due to presence of harmful chemical. The water purifier removes the taste causing chemicals and gives you purest possible water which contains healthy and nutritious elements that impart a great taste to it.\r\n\r\n3. Easy to use\r\n\r\nIt is more convenient to use than bottled water. You may have to be dependent on bottled water whereas you can get the water anytime from the purifier. You don’t have to drag the bottle around the house from the stores for getting the water whereas a water purifier gives you hygienic and safe water just by running the kitchen tap.\r\n\r\n4. Reasonably priced\r\n\r\nFinancially, Water from water purifier is lot cheaper than any other source. If we compare it with bottled water,in most of the cases, the bottled water is just the regular tap water or the water run through a commercial water purifier which may not be pure. The price we pay for on the bottled water is for the brand and the bottle. The quality of the water is no good and is expensive over the years. Whereas the water purifiers may seem a bit costly at first instance but if we compare the price we pay for other means and water purifier in the long run then then you will find the water purifier as the cheapest means of getting the pure and safe drinking water.\r\n\r\n5. Environment friendly\r\n\r\nWater purifiers do not emit any sort of pollutants in the environment, hence can be a green option for getting a pure water. When we use the bottled water, the bottles which are thrown in the environment just end up choking the water bodies and adding up to the pollutions and garbage.\r\n\r\n6. Reduces lime scaling\r\n\r\nThis may not be the main reason for getting the water purifier but is an additional perk attached to it. The purified water when used in kitchen other than drinking, reduces the building of lime scaling in the utensils and machines like coffee machine or electric kettles.\r\nAbove all, with the use of water purifier, you will get less reasons of falling ill and will be safe from dangerous diseases that may crop up with the long term use of contaminated water.

This source of energy is also termed as renewable as the wind is a free source and by harnessing the same, they do not contributes in air or water pollution\r\n\r\nThe wind energy is harnessed since centuries for uses like:\r\n\r\nPumping water\r\nGrinding grain\r\n\r\nGenerating electricity\r\n\r\nWater Energy:\r\n\r\nHydropower is the energy generated from flowing water. The gravitational energy from the water is released as it falls. The flow can be in terms of melting snow or streams and rivers.\r\n\r\nThe energy from the water is harnessed by creating dams on the rivers.\r\nThe energy is generated from the water stored in reservoir at the dams. The water is released with force to generate the energy which can be used to generate electricity. This is a renewable source of energy as the source is natural and free once the dam is constructed.\r\n\r\nBiomass energy:\r\n\r\nEnergy generated from natural wastes is called as biomass energy. The sources can be:\r\nScrap lumber\r\nForest debris\r\nCertain crops\r\nManure\r\n\r\nFood waste during processing and after use\r\n\r\nIt is also considered renewable energy because the waste will always generate and more of manages forests that will replenish the environment and their organic wastes.\r\n\r\nGeothermal energy: Geothermal energy is the heat from the Earth. It’s clean and sustainable. The geothermal energy is generated from the shallow ground, hot water natural geysers, hot rocks or the molten rocks available in the form of magna. \r\n\r\nThe technologies are developed to harness the geothermal energy. It can be used for:\r\n\r\nGeothermal Electricity\r\n\r\nSpace heating and cooling\r\n\r\nFood preparation\r\n\r\nHot spring bathing and spas\r\n\r\nAgriculture\r\n\r\nAquaculture\r\n\r\nGreenhouses\r\n\r\nIndustrial processes.', 'pexels-pixabay-159397.jpg', '', 77, 37, '2022-11-20 12:59:08'),
(95, 'How to Improve Foreign Relationships that are Constantly Changing', 'Welcoming new Marine rotational deployments in Australia and Navy rotations planned for Singapore, the top U.S. Pacific Command officer said he’ll seek similar arrangements, possibly to include the Army, that expand U.S. presence in the region without the need for more permanently based forces.\r\n\r\nNavy Adm. Samuel J. Locklear Jr. noted the arrival of about 200 U.S. Marines in Darwin, Australia, last month for the first six-month rotations serving alongside the Australian Defense Force.\r\n\r\n“It’s only a small group thus far, but over the next several years, we would like to grow that to about 2,500,” he said during an interview here with American Forces Press Service.\r\n\r\nBased at Australia’s Robertson Barracks outside Darwin, the Marines are bolstering U.S. theater engagement in the Asia-Pacific region -- a major goal in the new defense strategic guidance -- without the need for new infrastructure or permanent U.S. bases, Locklear noted. \r\n\r\nThe Marines provide “an increase in your ability to be forward, which provides a tremendous ability to work with our partners and build those relationships,” he said.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the Navy’s new littoral combat ship, USS Freedom, is scheduled for its first 10-month rotational deployment to Singapore beginning next spring. If Singapore agrees, Locklear said, he ultimately would like to expand the arrangement to include additional littoral ships.\r\n\r\nAll, he said, will be positioned alongside a strong, reliable partner near the strategic Straits of Malacca that links the Indian and Pacific oceans. “It will give us a unique, credible combat credibility for our maritime security, particularly in one of the largest choke points in the world,” he said.\r\n\r\nLocklear said he’d like to build on these models as he implements the new strategic guidance that emphasizes the importance of Asia and the Pacific. Already, the Army has approached him with an interest in rotating units into Asia and the Pacific as operations wind down in Afghanistan. That makes sense, he added, noting that five of the world’s largest armies are in the region.\r\n\r\n“Our ability to operate effectively, cross-Army to cross-Army, has not been good in the last decade or so, because most Army assets were tied up in the Middle East,” he said. “So we are really going to pursue some good opportunities in that regard.”\r\n\r\nRotational forces provide “an uptick in presence” that he said complements that provided by the 330,000 service members permanently based within the U.S. Pacific Command area of responsibility.\r\n\r\n“What they provide is an ability to work with our allies and to leverage the capabilities of the allies across all aspects of peace to conflict,” the admiral said. Meanwhile, he added, the additional presence rotational forces provide creates regional footholds that could pay off if the United States had to flow more forces to protect U.S. or allies interests there.\r\n\r\nThat presence, and the experience base it helps to build, would be particularly valuable in a disaster requiring humanitarian assistance, such as the earthquake and tsunami in Japan, or any other crisis, he said.\r\n\r\n“It gives training to the forces that rotate in and out,” he explained, so they are familiar with the region and the regional militaries if they need to work together. He cited last year’s Operation Tomodachi in Japan as an example. “So there is a lot of value to it,” he said.\r\n\r\nWhile anticipating no change in the number of permanently assigned U.S. troops in the region, Locklear said, he expects to see a “reshaped military” that’s able to deploy more throughout the region, particularly to allies and partner countries. He noted the realignment of base infrastructure under way or planned in Japan, Guam and South Korea. \r\n\r\nThe United States and Japan agreed last month on a plan to relocate about 9,000 U.S. Marines from Okinawa. About 5,000 will move to Guam, with the rest to transfer elsewhere in the region.\r\n\r\nIn addition, almost all of the 28,500 U.S. service members in Korea will have completed the move south of South Korea’s capital of Seoul, most of them to Camp Humphreys, in the coming years. \r\n\r\nAll but a tiny residual force will leave U.S. Army Garrison Yongsan, current home to U.S. Forces Korea and Combined Forces Korea in the heart of Seoul, and the 2nd Infantry Division and its supporting elements will relocate from Camp Casey and its tiny satellite bases north of the capital.\r\n\r\n“We are working hard, between the U.S. government and our allies, to ensure that we do the right things now to ensure the success of both moves,” Locklear said. Meanwhile, the Japanese government has the lead in setting a timeline for the movement of Marine Corps Air Station Futenma to a more remote area of Okinawa.\r\n\r\nAs this reshaping takes place, Locklear said, members of Pacom should “expect to stay busy” and continuing doing the “great work they are doing today.”\r\n\r\n“They need to stay focused on the job at hand,” he said, and be ready to carry out whatever mission is asked of them.\r\n\r\n“When required, they have to be able to produce what is necessary -- either build relationships, provide better security, and to deter and dissuade [aggression],” he said. “And if deterrence fails, they have to be able to fight and win. And that is what we get paid to do.”', 'pexels-august-de-richelieu-4427630.jpg', '', 64, 37, '2022-11-20 13:55:22'),
(96, 'How to Maintain National Strength on a Limited Budget', 'The military’s reserve components remain ready and capable despite budget cuts and their transition from a strategic to the operational force, senior National Guard and Reserve officials told the Senate Appropriations Committee’s defense subcommittee here yesterday.\r\n\r\nAs the drawdown continues in Afghanistan, the Guard and Reserve will maintain deployment-ready units undeterred by force structure changes such as the Air National Guard’s end strength reduction by 5,100 billets and aircraft inventory reduction by 134 aircraft, Air Force Gen. Craig R. McKinley, National Guard Bureau chief, told the senators.\r\n\r\nFor example, McKinley said, the Air National Guard’s partnership with more than 60 foreign countries has strengthened the component’s military capacity and competence.\r\n\r\nAir Force Lt. Gen. Harry M. Wyatt III, Air National Guard director, said 22 partner nations have provided 11,000 troops to Afghanistan, and 40 partner nations have provided more than 31,000 personnel in support of U.N. peacekeeping operations. Last year, Guard airmen filled about 54,000 requests for manpower, he added, noting that 91 percent of those requests were fulfilled with volunteers.\r\n\r\nWyatt said the Air National Guard’s budget request priorities were to align force size and composition to be flexible, agile and ready with a focus on new missions, such as the MC-12 intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance aircraft and remotely piloted aircraft. He added that other high priorities included maintaining a combat-ready force able to quickly surge and integrate seamlessly in joint operations while rearranging units impacted by the base closure and realignment process and recent programming changes.\r\n\r\nLt. Gen. William E. Ingram Jr., Army National Guard director, said the Army National Guard provides cost-effective solutions to meet budget requirements. For 12.3 percent of the Army\'s base budget, he said, the Army National Guard provides 39 percent of the Army\'s operating forces. In 2011, he told the panel, citizen-soldiers provided 900,000 duty days of support to communities across the nation.\r\n\r\n“We are attracting skilled soldiers and future leaders,” he said. “With the nation at war as a backdrop, our year-to-date enlistment rate for [fiscal 2012] is in excess of 95 percent, but our retention rate exceeds 130 percent. So we are meeting our authorized end strength of 358,000.”\r\n\r\nVice Adm. Dirk J. Debbink, Navy Reserve chief, said reserve sailors provide full- and part-time operational capabilities and strategic depth for maritime missions, ensuring rapid global response to crisis situations while maintaining fiscal efficiency across the spectrum of operations.\r\n\r\n“The Reserve C-40A Program is enabling our critical intratheater lift capability today to be more cost-effective and flexible, and thus more operationally relevant well into the future,” he said. “Our 2012 budget request will enable the Navy Reserve to continue supporting current operations while maximizing the strategic value of the Navy Reserve, a force valued for its readiness, innovation, agility and accessibility.”\r\n\r\nLt. Gen. Steven A. Hummer, commander of Marine Forces Reserve, said that as the active-component Marine Corps reshapes from 201,000 Marines to a force of about 182,100, the Marine Corps Reserve will leverage its diverse depth and range to mitigate risk and maximize opportunities.\r\n\r\n“I am highly confident that the authorized Marine Corps [Reserve] end strength of 39,600 is appropriate for providing us with the personnel required to support the total force during active component build-down,” he said.\r\nThe Air Force Reserve, however, may face personnel challenges, with a projected reduction of 900 personnel that Lt. Gen. Charles E. Stenner Jr., Air Force Reserve chief, described as the “tip of the iceberg.”\r\n\r\n“Our Reserve is losing trained personnel and taking on new missions,” he said. “The personnel losses are in specialties that are still essential to the total force and at the same time don\'t easily transfer to newly assigned mission areas.”\r\n\r\nStenner noted that an aircraft maintainer with 17 years of experience cannot become a cyber warrior with 17 years of experience overnight. “With that perspective, the Air Force is actually losing the capability of 5,000 to 6,000 experienced and trained personnel, and that loss could seriously affect the strategic reserve posture,” he told the senators.\r\n\r\nLt. Gen. Jack C. Stultz, Army Reserve chief, said the quality of his citizen-soldiers gives him confidence for the force’s future. He told the panel about Sgt. Daniel Burgess, who lost his leg and suffered severe wounds to the rest of his body from a roadside bomb explosion while attached to a Marine Corps unit in southern Afghanistan. Burgess insisted on remaining in the military and is rehabilitating at the Warrior Training Brigade at Fort Sam Houston, Texas.\r\n\r\n“That epitomizes why we\'re here; we\'re here because of them,” Stultz said. “We\'ve got to make sure we\'re doing everything within our power in an era where we are looking to save money and reduce debt, but we cannot afford to shortchange these great soldiers, because they are protecting our nation, and they\'re our first line of defense.”\r\nMcKinley told the senators the reserve components have evolved from being a strategic reserve to an operational force over the last decade of war, and that should be the way of the future.\r\n\r\n“During a time of constrained budgets, we should continue to be used as an operational force to ensure the nation is getting the most defense capability at the lowest cost,” McKinley said, adding that more than 50 percent of Guardsmen have combat experience.', 'pexels-karolina-grabowska-4386366.jpg', '', 64, 39, '2022-11-20 14:05:07');

(97, 'Dynamic Wealth Management Headlines: Whose Economy Has It Worst?', 'It’s no wonder that global markets are so jittery. The world’s three largest economies can’t continue along their current paths, and everybody knows it. Investors watch nervously for signs that China is headed toward a hard landing, that America will sink back into recession, and that the euro zone will simply implode.\r\n\r\nIn all three cases, kicking the can down the road has staved off disaster so far, but the cans are getting bigger and heavier. Which economy will be the first to stumble on its problems?\r\nIn Europe, the tough decisions have been put off because the principal players don’t agree on how or why the trouble began. \r\n\r\nGermany and the other better-off countries blame the profligacy of Greece, Portugal and Italy and fear that an early bailout would relieve pressure on them to mend their ways. For their part, the debtor nations believe that the entire euro zone is out of balance and that more prosperous countries like Germany should export less and consume more to set things right.\r\n\r\nOther Europeans say that a shared currency cannot survive indefinitely when monetary policy is centrally managed but each government decides how much to tax and spend. Still others warn that access to market capital requires a form of collective insurance, preferably in the form of a euro bond. Not surprisingly, Germany resists this solution because it implies a gradual transfer of wealth from the core economies to the periphery, a “transfer union” from rich to poorer states.\r\n\r\nYet another European view holds that the austerity plans now envisioned by Germany and the European Central Bank are worse than the disease. The Continent needs growth, not just reform and belt-tightening, they argue, and only a surge of stimulus across the entire euro area can achieve it.\r\n\r\nThe 17 countries and four European institutions now entangled in the euro zone crisis will continue trying to muddle through, but their dawdling can’t be sustained. Markets are already losing confidence in piecemeal reform. Doubts about Italy, an economy too big to bail, will only add to the volatility.\r\n\r\nEurope will be the first to drop out of the game of kick the can: Expect a disorderly debt default in Greece, more trouble for European banks and a sharp recession across the continent.\r\n\r\nIn China, the need for economic reform also has become obvious. It has been four years since Premier Wen Jiabao first warned that the country’s economic model is “unstable, unbalanced, uncoordinated and ultimately unsustainable” and three years since the financial crisis made clear that China’s growth remains dangerously dependent on exports to Europe, America and Japan.\r\n\r\nTo ensure long-term economic expansion (and political stability), Beijing must figure out a way to encourage Chinese consumers to buy more of the products that local manufacturers make. This will demand a massive transfer of wealth from the state and China’s state-owned companies to Chinese households.\r\n\r\nBut Beijing is moving in the opposite direction. The leadership responded to Western market turmoil not by boosting consumption but by increasing state and private spending on fixed investment, which now accounts for nearly half of China’s growth. The result has been an explosion in residential and commercial real estate, more state spending on infrastructure and more cheap loans from state-owned banks to state-owned enterprises.\r\n\r\nIndeed, a key obstacle to reform is that China remains so heavily invested in its state-managed model of capitalism. Of the 42 Chinese companies listed in the 2010 edition of the Fortune 500, 39 were state-owned enterprises, and three quarters of China’s 100 largest publicly traded companies are government controlled. \r\n\r\nParty officials with a stake in the success of state-owned enterprises have amassed considerable power within the leadership, and they ferociously resist efforts to transfer away their wealth to private enterprises and ordinary citizens.\r\nChina has the cash and foreign reserves to postpone a crisis. But growth is slowing, financial stresses are rising, and there is good reason to fear that China’s days of can-kicking are numbered as well.\r\n\r\nWhich leaves the U.S. No one can restore confidence in America’s long-term fiscal health without a credible plan to cut spending on entitlements and defense while raising revenues, which are now at a 60-year low as a share of GDP. But don’t expect any immediate solutions from Washington. The campaign season will only exacerbate petty partisanship and political gridlock, which means that the structural problems of the U.S. economy are likely to persist.\r\n\r\nBut the longer-term future appears much brighter for the U.S. than for either Europe or China. America is still the leader in the kind of cutting-edge technology that expands a nation’s long-term economic potential, from renewable energy and medical devices to nanotechnology and cloud computing. Over time, these advantages will yield more robust economic growth.\r\n\r\nThe U.S. also has a demographic advantage. In Europe, declining birthrates and rising sentiment against immigration point toward a population that will shrink by as much as 100 million people by 2050. In China, thanks in part to its one-child policy, the working population has already begun to contract. By 2030, nearly 250 million Chinese will have passed the age of 65, and providing them with pensions and health care will be very costly.\r\n\r\nDespite debate over illegal immigration, the U.S. population will likely rise from 310 million to about 420 million by midcentury. Between 2000 and 2050, according to Mark Schill of Praxis Strategy Group, the U.S. workforce is expected to grow by 37%. China’s will shrink by 10%. Europe’s will contract by 21%.\r\n\r\nFinally, despite the rising exasperation of the American public, the U.S. is significantly more likely than Europe or China to quit kicking the can down the road. Nothing much will change during the election year, but 2013 offers a chance for real fiscal reform.\r\n\r\nNext November, Republicans are likely to win both houses of Congress. If a Republican is elected president, the GOP will face enormous public pressure to deliver on its reform promises. Even if President Obama is re-elected, the outlook for a grand bargain is bright. He would be free of the most immediate demands of electoral politics, and like other second-term presidents, he could begin to consider his legacy.\r\n\r\nMake no mistake: The challenges that the U.S. faces are formidable, and persistent political gridlock could delay badly needed fiscal and structural reforms. But everything is relative, and the best can to be kicking down the road just now is undoubtedly the one made in America.', 'pexels-tima-miroshnichenko-7567443.jpg', '', 64, 39, '2022-11-20 14:09:02'),

Here are some of the spots to have fun with your friends and family. Make memories, experiences, and lessons from every trip.\r\n\r\nHello my folks! \r\n\r\nWelcome back to my Sydney Stories. \r\n\r\nWell,Guest Posting well well... I have something that is so overwhelming to tell you. \r\n\r\nI am literally amazed by your response to my writings. I was doubting myself but you guys proved that I\'m wrong. Thank you for all those amazing responses. Many of you asked why I am so into Sydney and enquired what that is so consumes me in Sydney. \r\n\r\nSome of them (those recent followers in the list) checked my tour history and requested me to tell something about my first trip experiences. Yeah... Sure. Why not?! \r\n\r\nSo today’s blog is a walk through my memories... Recollections or glimpses from my first trip experience. Those who came late to my space and really wanted to explore more... This is for you. \r\n\r\nSydney, the Capital of New South Wales\r\n\r\nYaas! Sydney, the capital of the state of New South Wales was my first and the most favourite trip (now you know... Sydney is more like a first-born!). I was flown to Sydney with my school besties when I was 20 (I was a travel enthusiast from a very young age).\r\n\r\nIt was for a New Year\'s Day party (2006, I guess. Huh... Did I just reveal my age?! Damn! I was not planning to). Well, we had spent almost a week in the Sydney domain. Believe me, the New Year’s Eve fireworks cruise in Sydney Harbour was the best I had so far. \r\n\r\nWe get onboard in an authentic paddle wheeler that has a spectacular cabaret show by an Australian cast. It was an all inclusive package, I remember. We had cruise, entertainment, amazing Sydney Harbour views, fun, deluxe five course dinner, and drinks from that New Year’s Eve cruise around Sydney Harbour. \r\n\r\nIf you haven’t been to Sydney, grab your seats for the next New Year’s Eve party. So, Sydney is all about fireworks, colours, entertainment, the blue ocean, sunshine, cruising restaurants, and fun for me (honestly, which is unique and unequalled). \r\n\r\nThe Island of Mauritius \r\n\r\nHave you ever been to Mauritius? Mauritius is an Indian Ocean Island nation well-known for its beaches, coloured sand, cultural diversity, colonial history and so on. I spent almost a month on this rich island as part of an NGO campaigning that I am very proud about. I got a chance to hang out with a set of cool, serene people. \r\n\r\nWe all visited Chamarel Coloured Earth Geopark in Mauritius. Amazed? Well...Continue! It is a natural phenomenon which is very unique to the land of Mauritius. Some reaction between basaltic lava to clay minerals resulted in this phenomenon which turned out to be one of the main tourist attractions in Mauritius. \r\n\r\nIt is a small area of sand with seven different colours. But the visitors are not allowed to play with this coloured Earth. But you can definitely play with some giant tortoises who are roaming around the adjacent playground. There is a lot more to tell about the Mauritius trip. Maybe I can write something later about the whole Mauritius thing without fail (I promise! I’m not lying). \r\n\r\nI was thinking about how privileged I am to travel around the globe, to have money to spend on, to taste distinct signature cuisine of many continents and countries, to have some amazing set of new travel buddies, and all. It is okay if you haven’t outpoured the energy of a travel enthusiast in you. Because, I am damn sure of the fact that if you are a travel enthusiast, you will not be in that state of hibernation for so long. You can definitely explore the world that you are longing to. \r\n\r\nIf you are not that into a solo trip, and have no hesitation to have a travel partner, try adding someone who is not privileged as you are for the next time.

Many believe that the interior is all about beautifying a space. Beauty is not the only plan behind decoration and design. The main idea is to give a space meaning and a purpose.\r\n\r\nFor instance, wall shelves and racks not only look aesthetically charming with their rich wooden or metallic textures. However, more importantly, they provide storage space that allows items and decorations to be stacked elegantly. Similarly, mirrors look strikingly charming, and they give our walls a dynamic personality. However, they also assist the purpose of creating the illusion of spaciousness, which is ideal for small spaces.\r\n\r\nInterior designing can transform an entire home and give it a dynamic purpose and appeal. In this article, we will explore how interior décor can change the whole property.\r\n\r\nLET US GET STARTED, SHALL WE?\r\n\r\n1. PERSONALIZATION\r\n\r\nThe very first thing that you want to achieve through décor is personalization. You want your home to radiate a vibe that is consistent with your personality and taste, from choosing color palettes and furniture to the wall décor, decorations, and more. Space must personalize to your liking.\r\n\r\nIf you adore the rustic accents of wood and timber, you can achieve a farmhouse-style countryside vibe. Many homeowners appreciate the simplistic tones of minimalist décor, and they choose a sleek metallic and steel furnishings. Homeowners who like bright colors often explore rich and vibrant ethnic décor, such as Moroccan rugs and Aztec art.\r\n\r\nBohemians prefer rich and vibrant tapestries, green plants, and Boho decorations.

COMFORT\r\n\r\nA house serves the purpose of providing comfort and shelter to its inhabitants. Each room has a purpose; for instance, the living room is a place for lounging, sharing moments, and watching television. The bedroom invites with its unmatched comfort and seclusion, while the outdoor space allows one to reconnect with nature.\r\n\r\nHow can you make every room comfortable and inviting? It is quite simple; you need to choose and incorporate furniture and fixtures to make the space comfortable. Consider investing in comfortable sofas and couches, and place them strategically across each room. You can also choose between floor seating with precious carpets and rugs and soft floor cushions.\r\n\r\nMany homeowners prefer elaborately designed beds, while others prefer the comfort of sleeping on a mattress on the floor. Again, convenience is all about preferences and tastes. Be sure to incorporate the comfort of every family member when styling each room.\r\n\r\n3. DECORATION\r\n\r\nDecoration and ornamentation is the last tier of interior decoration, and it must focus after you addressed comfort and personalization.

It is ideal for concentrating on ornamentation once you have decked up area with comfortable furniture.\r\n\r\nDécor is all about giving your space an aesthetically pleasing and charming personality. Naturally, this personality must align with your tastes and preferences. If you like vibrant and ornamented walls, consider investing in fine art, paintings, and iconic imagery. If you adore photography, you can create elaborate photo walls featuring a lifetime of memories.\r\n\r\nSmall and large spaces have their own decoration needs. For instance, ample space needs to convert with a homely and inviting warmth. On the other hand, a small area needs décor items that create the illusion of spaciousness. Simple tricks, such as a large mirror, elegant shelves, and smart furniture, can make a huge impact.\r\n\r\nYou can completely transform the vibe of your space with a fresh coat of paint. It does not cost much, and you can explore colors that appeal to your personality and tastes. Explore bright and bold colors for rooms that grab attention, and subtle colors to balance out the décor in certain areas.\r\n\r\nTHE FINAL WORD\r\n\r\nInterior décor is a marriage between comfort and style. If your home is over-decorated and it denies your satisfaction, you will remain dissatisfied with your interior. On the other hand, if it is excessively comfortable and lacks aesthetic presentation, you will find yourself yearning for decoration.\r\n\r\nThe trick is to cast a balance between personalization, decoration, and comfort. Each space must serve its purpose, and appeal to the aesthetic senses with its charm and beauty. It would be best if you commenced by serving your priorities of comfort and personalization and then move towards decorations.', 'pexels-tan-danh-1329711.jpg', '', 73, 38, '2022-11-20 15:32:06');
